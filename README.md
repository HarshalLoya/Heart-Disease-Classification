# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification

Welcome to the Heart Disease Classification project! In this repository, we explore the use of machine learning to predict heart disease based on various clinical parameters. 

## 🚀 Problem Definition

Our goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease using binary classification. Given clinical parameters, can we accurately determine if a patient has heart disease?

## 📊 Data

The data for this project comes from the [Cleveland database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We've formatted it for use in this project and downloaded it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset).

The dataset contains 14 attributes (features) which we will use to predict our target variable (heart disease or not).

## 🎯 Evaluation

Our initial goal is to reach **95% accuracy** in predicting heart disease. This serves as a benchmark for our machine learning model and may evolve as we continue experimentation.

## 📋 Features

Here's a summary of the features in our dataset:

1. **age** - Age in years
2. **sex** - (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. **cp** - Chest pain type
   - 0: Typical angina
   - 1: Atypical angina
   - 2: Non-anginal pain
   - 3: Asymptomatic
4. **trestbps** - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
5. **chol** - Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. **fbs** - Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. **restecg** - Resting electrocardiographic results
   - 0: Nothing to note
   - 1: ST-T wave abnormality
   - 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
8. **thalach** - Maximum heart rate achieved
9. **exang** - Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. **slope** - Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
   - 0: Upsloping
   - 1: Flatsloping
   - 2: Downsloping
12. **ca** - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
13. **thal** - Thalium stress result
   - 1,3: Normal
   - 6: Fixed defect
   - 7: Reversible defect
14. **target** - Have disease or not (1 = yes; 0 = no)
